# UFO Finder
## Overview
This JavaScript project creates an HTML page that takes user inputs as filter criteria and outputs data about UFO sightings. The raw data for UFO activity was scraped, saved in a file, and presented as a table on a webpage with an introduction and various stylings. 
## Results

All filters can be set individually. However, when specifying more than parameter, the search will only include results with both criteria (AND). 
## Summary
One drawback of this design is that it doesn’t allow the user to select multiple filters unless they are in conjunction. This makes it difficult to cross-reference dissimilar events. It would be nice to have a search that is based on other logic (OR or XOR). As it stands, the webpage is less than intuitive. An action button and a “clear fields” button would be helpful in creating a smoother user experience.
